# Sleep Tracker
Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by to take a look at our sleep tracker.

Here are some of features:

- Both **Web** and native **iOS/Android** support through [**Ionic**](https://ionicframework.com/)
- A clean, reactive, tabular UI built with [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) and **IonicUI**
- Intelligently implemented **haptic feedback** throughout the app
- Persistent data

Here's a peek at the [iOS app](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/x3YlGaErjMI) and the [web app](https://youtube.com/shorts/kXt53_QfWRY).
