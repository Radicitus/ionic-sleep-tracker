Raffi and Cam. Everything.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No


--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
No. We just designed it with an everyday average user in mind. Our app is easy to use so people of all ages can use
and understand how the app works.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
iOS


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
They log overnight sleep by pressing a button before they fall asleep and then pressing a button when they wake up.
We chose to support logging overnight sleep like this because its similar to a stopwatch so you can see exactly how long the user slept.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
A user can log sleepiness during the day by selecting a number between 1-7(according to the stanford sleep study)
and then writing a small note if they want and then saving that data.
We chose to do it like this so that we can have an easy way for the user to track their level of sleepiness and maybe leave a reason why.



10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
They click on the sleep log tab and then they will see a table where their logged sleepiness with a date, number, and note and their logged sleep with what night and how long they slept.



11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
Native Device Resource


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?

We added haptics. This does not change the user experience.


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
There is an easy, useful initial view where a user can instantly start tracking sleep or
navigate to a different page in order to log sleepiness or check saved data.
You can change tabs easily if you navigate to the wrong one
There are no extra buttons or ways to make errors
We tested the app on our actual iOS device to make sure it worked and looked like other iOS apps.
